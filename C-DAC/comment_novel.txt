Greetings, friends! I am Divya Bhagwani, Shiv Pratap Pradesh, and you are listening to Mobile Varta. I would like to discuss the benefits of changing the law books for the public. In my opinion, I would say that changing law books offers no benefit to the public because crime continues to rise. Even if laws are changed, I don't think it will curb crime so quickly. Crime has increased to such an extent that no law book can reduce it. Cases drag on for so long that people die before they are concluded. Therefore, no law book can change this world, these people, or these crimes. Greetings, friends! I am Divya Bhagwani, Shiv Pratap Pradesh, and you are listening to Mobile Varta.
Greetings, friends! I am Dipya Bhagwani, Supree Majboodesyo. You are listening to Mobile Vani, and in the program currently airing on Mobile Vani, a very good issue has been raised from the book, "Laws." Both sides of the argument – the proponents and the opponents – should be presented. There is an understanding that both sides will be presented. However, if there is any debate regarding the enforcement of the law, and if this will have an impact on the public, then... Greetings.
Welcome to Mobile Vaarta. You are listening to Mobile Vaarta, and I am Sanjay Kumar Bhabur, on Mobile Vaarta. In a democratic system, law holds significant importance. The recent amendments to the law enacted by the Indian government have raised several concerns. We will hear Jayramji's perspective on this – what are his views, Jayramji? Jayramji will share his reaction to these recent legal changes. In Indian democracy, the ruling government can alter laws as per its discretion. What impact do these changes have on the public? A comparison with the IPC and CrPC would be necessary to fully assess this. What is your opinion on the removal of the aforementioned British-era laws? Do you consider this appropriate? What is your response to this? There were some ambiguities, which were presumed to be resolved after implementation. And how well will it suit the traditional Indian society? What impact will this have on the public? The impact on the public will only be seen after implementation. Whether it fits perfectly or generates further confusion and problems, only time will tell. Let's conduct this interview on Mobile Vaarta. Thank you very much.
Greetings listeners. I'm Rahul Kumar from Siwan district, and you're listening to Community Radio Siwan Mobile Wireless. Friends, the government is making changes to the legal framework. A bill has been introduced in the Parliament for this purpose. The reason for this change is being cited as the outdated nature of the laws, created during the British era. However, the question arises: what impact will these changes have on our lives and society? So, let's discuss this with Mr. Naveen Kumar, a member of the International Human Rights Organization, to understand the potential impact of these amendments on our society. Firstly, Naveen Ji, welcome to our studio. We'd like you to briefly introduce yourself. Yes, I'm Naveen Kumar, a human rights activist from Darbhanga. Naveen Ji, we want to understand the changes the government is making to the laws enacted during the British Raj. Can you briefly explain the potential impact of these changes on our lives? Well, earlier, when a prisoner was held, they would be subjected to torture (or other forms of coercion) and forced to confess if they were part of a gang. This instilled fear, deterring people from engaging in criminal activities. Now, fear is non-existent.
