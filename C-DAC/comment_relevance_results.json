The government should make changes to the law keeping finances in mind. And, people should be informed about this law! Previously, this law existed. Because of it, these problems arose. And, after the new law comes into effect, people should be taken into confidence; millions and millions of people should be confident that they will not have to face difficulties.",

In my opinion, I would say that changing law books offers no benefit to the public because crime continues to rise. Even if laws are changed, I don't think it will curb crime so quickly. Crime has increased to such an extent that no law book can reduce it. Cases drag on for so long that people die before they are concluded. Therefore, no law book can change this world, these people, or these crimes. Greetings, friends! I am Divya Bhagwani, Shiv Pratap Pradesh, and you are listening to Mobile Varta.",

The recent amendments to the law enacted by the Indian government have raised several concerns. We will hear Jayramji's perspective on this – what are his views, Jayramji? Jayramji will share his reaction to these recent legal changes. In Indian democracy, the ruling government can alter laws as per its discretion. What impact do these changes have on the public? A comparison with the IPC and CrPC would be necessary to fully assess this. What is your opinion on the removal of the aforementioned British-era laws? Do you consider this appropriate? What is your response to this? There were some ambiguities, which were presumed to be resolved after implementation. And how well will it suit the traditional Indian society? What impact will this have on the public? The impact on the public will only be seen after implementation. Whether it fits perfectly or generates further confusion and problems, only time will tell.

This post-independence legal amendment, we believe, is a landmark event. We present to you the views of the esteemed lawyer Manoj Kumar Ji on this event, through Mobile Waani. Regarding this legal amendment, what is your perspective? A committee should be formed, comprising suitable individuals, who are present and engaged in the process. This relates to what you call the Indian Constitution, or as it's known in English, the Constitution. A selection of suitable individuals should be present and reach a consensus to bring about a change that alters our ideology, delivers justice to the people, and completely eradicates crime. Therefore, this is a very positive step, a commendable step. Public opinion suggests that many believe this is arbitrary action by the Home Minister. What's your response to that? No, that's not the case. It cannot be termed arbitrary action by the Home Minister. They may have had a perception of the situation's urgency. There was a realization, an understanding from the Home Minister's perspective; that's why this decision was taken. Their decision is laudable. What",

Friends, the government is making changes to the legal framework. A bill has been introduced in the Parliament for this purpose. The reason for this change is being cited as the outdated nature of the laws, created during the British era. However, the question arises: what impact will these changes have on our lives and society? So, let's discuss this with Mr. Naveen Kumar, a member of the International Human Rights Organization, to understand the potential impact of these amendments on our society. Firstly, Naveen Ji, welcome to our studio. We'd like you to briefly introduce yourself. Yes, I'm Naveen Kumar, a human rights activist from Darbhanga. Naveen Ji, we want to understand the changes the government is making to the laws enacted during the British Raj. Can you briefly explain the potential impact of these changes on our lives? Well, earlier, when a prisoner was held, they would be subjected to torture (or other forms of coercion) and forced to confess if they were part of a gang. This instilled fear, deterring people from engaging in criminal activities. Now, fear is non-existent.",

Therefore, the corruption prevalent in Bihar will continue unless we strengthen governance. It's an impossible task. While improvements are expected, there will be challenges. If the bill passed in Parliament is lenient, it will lead to further problems. If it's stringent, it might bring some relief. That's essentially your point, right? One more question: what do you think will be the impact of a stricter law on our country in the future? Your suggestions are valuable to us and we are very grateful for your insights on this matter.

The diary raises several points, some of which I feel have been left unaddressed. I request you to elaborate on these points and clarify them for us. Furthermore, concerning the law, currently there seem to be two different legal systems operating simultaneously: one for specific communities and another for ordinary citizens. If we consider recent events, cases against those who ran over farmers and those who trampled them took a considerable amount of time to be filed. The media extensively highlighted this, and only then did some action begin. There are numerous issues on which the government remains completely silent. In conclusion, I believe that if our nation’s constitution is properly implemented, our country will gain momentum and undoubtedly progress.

Enacting new laws will not improve the condition of the poor in the interest of the public. Unless bills are passed after thorough surveys conducted in the genuine interest of the people, bringing such legislation will never make India great. Today, numerous bills are being passed, but with no meaningful change. Neither poverty will reduce nor will anything improve. In no way will these new bills bring about public welfare. Passing such bills is merely a waste of time. Remember, how many bills have been passed already, yet poverty in India remains rampant. People are still deprived of housing, food, clean drinking water, and education – rights that they deserve but have yet to receive. So, will new bills only further marginalize these very people? Inflation will never decrease. No, no, no. Public welfare cannot be achieved simply by passing bills. Thank you.",

These laws were implemented by our scholar, Kishen Kumar Thakur. Mr. Kishen Kumar Thakur will explain whether these amendments are beneficial to the public or not. Three major amendments to the Criminal Major Act have been made, and it can be said that the new laws replacing them are largely beneficial to the public. These amendments remove the vestiges of British rule from our laws. They enhance citizen security and rights. The previously one-sided, or rather, repressive nature of the police force against ordinary citizens has been curbed. This has resulted in significant benefits. Furthermore, our Indian Penal Code, renamed the Indian Justice Code, has undergone substantial and valuable changes. The number of sections, previously 511, has been reduced to approximately 356. Similarly, offences related to women's harassment are now placed in the first chapter of this Act. Likewise, crimes causing harm to humans are in the second chapter, given priority. Many sections have been changed. For example, the cheating section, previously section 420, is no longer used. Instead, section 354 can be used for",

Similarly, the CRPC has also been amended, increasing the number of sections. Therefore, the revised order, formerly section 420, is now under the third section. Sections 500 and above, encompassing various offences, have been removed. This is a correct decision by the government, arrived at after thorough consideration and consultation with experts. Many scholars and advocates contributed to its creation. It has now been sent to the translation committee. After that, it will be presented in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
