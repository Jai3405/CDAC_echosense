    "comment": "Greetings, friends! I am Divya Bhagwani, Shiv Pratap Pradesh, and you are listening to Mobile Varta. I would like to discuss the benefits of changing the law books for the public. In my opinion, I would say that changing law books offers no benefit to the public because crime continues to rise. Even if laws are changed, I don't think it will curb crime so quickly. Crime has increased to such an extent that no law book can reduce it. Cases drag on for so long that people die before they are concluded. Therefore, no law book can change this world, these people, or these crimes. Greetings, friends! I am Divya Bhagwani, Shiv Pratap Pradesh, and you are listening to Mobile Varta.",

There is an understanding that both sides will be presented. However, if there is any debate regarding the enforcement of the law, and if this will have an impact on the public, then... Greetings.",

    "comment": "Welcome to Mobile Vaarta. You are listening to Mobile Vaarta, and I am Sanjay Kumar Bhabur, on Mobile Vaarta. In a democratic system, law holds significant importance. The recent amendments to the law enacted by the Indian government have raised several concerns. We will hear Jayramji's perspective on this – what are his views, Jayramji? Jayramji will share his reaction to these recent legal changes. In Indian democracy, the ruling government can alter laws as per its discretion. What impact do these changes have on the public? A comparison with the IPC and CrPC would be necessary to fully assess this. What is your opinion on the removal of the aforementioned British-era laws? Do you consider this appropriate? What is your response to this? There were some ambiguities, which were presumed to be resolved after implementation. And how well will it suit the traditional Indian society? What impact will this have on the public? The impact on the public will only be seen after implementation. Whether it fits perfectly or generates further confusion and problems, only time will tell. Let's conduct this interview on Mobile Vaarta. Thank you very much.",

    "comment": "Greetings listeners. I'm Rahul Kumar from Siwan district, and you're listening to Community Radio Siwan Mobile Wireless. Friends, the government is making changes to the legal framework. A bill has been introduced in the Parliament for this purpose. The reason for this change is being cited as the outdated nature of the laws, created during the British era. However, the question arises: what impact will these changes have on our lives and society? So, let's discuss this with Mr. Naveen Kumar, a member of the International Human Rights Organization, to understand the potential impact of these amendments on our society. Firstly, Naveen Ji, welcome to our studio. We'd like you to briefly introduce yourself. Yes, I'm Naveen Kumar, a human rights activist from Darbhanga. Naveen Ji, we want to understand the changes the government is making to the laws enacted during the British Raj. Can you briefly explain the potential impact of these changes on our lives? Well, earlier, when a prisoner was held, they would be subjected to torture (or other forms of coercion) and forced to confess if they were part of a gang. This instilled fear, deterring people from engaging in criminal activities. Now, fear is non-existent.",

Therefore, the corruption prevalent in Bihar will continue unless we strengthen governance. It's an impossible task. While improvements are expected, there will be challenges. If the bill passed in Parliament is lenient, it will lead to further problems. If it's stringent, it might bring some relief. That's essentially your point, right? One more question: what do you think will be the impact of a stricter law on our country in the future? Your suggestions are valuable to us and we are very grateful for your insights on this matter. Thank you for speaking with us. Regards to my listeners.",

    "comment": "Welcome to the Udayalwani Media Channel. Now, listen to Udayalwani, and I am Udayalwani Jayesh Amrita Sanjay Kumar Babbu. The recent legal amendments are historic. These laws were implemented by our scholar, Kishen Kumar Thakur. Mr. Kishen Kumar Thakur will explain whether these amendments are beneficial to the public or not. Three major amendments to the Criminal Major Act have been made, and it can be said that the new laws replacing them are largely beneficial to the public. These amendments remove the vestiges of British rule from our laws. They enhance citizen security and rights. The previously one-sided, or rather, repressive nature of the police force against ordinary citizens has been curbed. This has resulted in significant benefits. Furthermore, our Indian Penal Code, renamed the Indian Justice Code, has undergone substantial and valuable changes. The number of sections, previously 511, has been reduced to approximately 356. Similarly, offences related to women's harassment are now placed in the first chapter of this Act. Likewise, crimes causing harm to humans are in the second chapter, given priority. Many sections have been changed. For example, the cheating section, previously section 420, is no longer used. Instead, section 354 can be used for",

For example, the cheating section, previously section 420, is no longer used. Instead, section 354 can be used for defrauding individuals. Similarly, the CRPC has also been amended, increasing the number of sections. Therefore, the revised order, formerly section 420, is now under the third section. Sections 500 and above, encompassing various offences, have been removed. This is a correct decision by the government, arrived at after thorough consideration and consultation with experts. Many scholars and advocates contributed to its creation. It has now been sent to the translation committee. After that, it will be presented in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. There is scope for further amendments. Therefore, this law is beyond the purview of elections; it is universally known and inevitable, with no room for compromise.

Friends, in Mobilewani's special program, \"Paks-Vipaks\" (For and Against), we are joined today by Shikha Shukla ji for a discussion. Simply making changes won't achieve anything; the impact of enforcing the law will instill fear in the minds of criminals before they commit any crime. Therefore, instead of amending the law, its strict implementation is necessary. Ms. Shukla, thank you very much for your insightful views and for contributing to our discussion. We greatly appreciate you joining us on Mobilewani.",
