Greetings listeners. I'm Rahul Kumar from Siwan district, and you're listening to Community Radio Siwan Mobile Wireless. Friends, the government is making changes to the legal framework. A bill has been introduced in the Parliament for this purpose. The reason for this change is being cited as the outdated nature of the laws, created during the British era. However, the question arises: what impact will these changes have on our lives and society? So, let's discuss this with Mr. Naveen Kumar, a member of the International Human Rights Organization, to understand the potential impact of these amendments on our society. Firstly, Naveen Ji, welcome to our studio. We'd like you to briefly introduce yourself. Yes, I'm Naveen Kumar, a human rights activist from Darbhanga. Naveen Ji, we want to understand the changes the government is making to the laws enacted during the British Raj. Can you briefly explain the potential impact of these changes on our lives?

Welcome to the Udayalwani Media Channel. Now, listen to Udayalwani, and I am Udayalwani Jayesh Amrita Sanjay Kumar Babbu. The recent legal amendments are historic. These laws were implemented by our scholar, Kishen Kumar Thakur. Mr. Kishen Kumar Thakur will explain whether these amendments are beneficial to the public or not.

The previously one-sided, or rather, repressive nature of the police force against ordinary citizens has been curbed. This has resulted in significant benefits. Furthermore, our Indian Penal Code, renamed the Indian Justice Code, has undergone substantial and valuable changes. The number of sections, previously 511, has been reduced to approximately 356. Similarly, offences related to women's harassment are now placed in the first chapter of this Act. Likewise, crimes causing harm to humans are in the second chapter, given priority. Many sections have been changed. For example, the cheating section, previously section 420, is no longer used. Instead, section 354 can be used for
Greetings, friends! I am Shivani Rajak from Surat, Madhya Pradesh. You are all listening to Mobilewani. Friends, in Mobilewani's special program, "Paks-Vipaks" (For and Against), we are joined today by Shikha Shukla ji for a discussion. Simply making changes won't achieve anything; the impact of enforcing the law will instill fear in the minds of criminals before they commit any crime. Therefore, instead of amending the law, its strict implementation is necessary. Ms. Shukla, thank you very much for your insightful views and for contributing to our discussion. We greatly appreciate you joining us on Mobilewani.
