Greetings, friends! Today, we will discuss a crucial issue that is important to everyone; it may affect anyone or may have already impacted your life. Yes, the issue we are going to talk about today is related to crime. Various types of crimes occur across the world, some intentional and some unintentional. Provisions have also been made in this bill to prevent collusion and police misconduct. Laws like sedition are being abolished. The bill, proposed by Home Minister Amit Shah, proposes replacing the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Indian Evidence Act with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. Even before this bill was presented in Parliament, the Modi government has already amended or repealed over several hundred laws enacted during the British Raj. The recently presented bill proposes a complete overhaul of the entire penal code. After the introduction of this bill in Parliament, questions arise: Will the government rewrite the sections for crimes and their classification? Or will it simply amend the existing sections? Or will it remove them altogether? How will this reduce the incidence or nature of crime? The newly introduced bill will first abolish Section 124A of the IPC, enacted during the British
Or will it simply amend the existing sections? Or will it remove them altogether? How will this reduce the incidence or nature of crime? The newly introduced bill will first abolish Section 124A of the IPC, enacted during the British Raj. This section defined sedition as a crime according to the standards of that era. To address this, Section 150 has been included in Part VII of the bill for those committing crimes against the state. Therefore, a new debate has emerged in recent years regarding crimes like sedition and treason, due to a rise in cases registered under these sections. Questions have arisen about when opposing the government, or a particular party or ideology, came to be classified as sedition or treason. According to the new name and available details of the bill, it seems that the government is merely attempting to satisfy the sentiments of certain traditionalists, whose representatives are within the ruling party at the center, in the name of nationalism. What will be the benefits and consequences of this? Please record your opinion in favor of or against by pressing button number three on your phone. Thank you.
